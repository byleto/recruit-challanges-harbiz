2. Subsequent indexes: respective positions of the one-indexed 1-bits in n's binary representation.

Example:
  Input = 39 which binary representation is 100111 should return this output [ 4, 0, 3, 4, 5 ].
    4: there are 4 positive bits
    0, 3, 4 and 5: respective positions of the one-indexed 1-bits
